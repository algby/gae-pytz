# GAE pytz

A fork of pytz which works on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).


Based on [http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/caching-pytz-helper/](http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/caching-pytz-helper/) but modified so that it can be imported normally with `import pytz`.
